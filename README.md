Hi, I'm Joseph, W3MBG.  I am US-based ham radio operator and maker/tinkerer.  I enjoy 3d printing and building radios.

I've been a hobbyist coder off and on since learning html 4.0 as a teenager.  My main interest is microcontroller programming, especially RF and robotics applications.

Currently I am focusing on learning MicroPython
